Rotational structure of an anionic octahedron on 2x2x2 supercell

## Description
In crystals with a perovskite-type structure, oxygen octahedra (or anion octahedra) are known to have a tilt structure. These rotational structures can be expressed in a notation called Glazer notation.  
In this notebook, a structure with a 2x2x2 supercell (8-fold compositional formula of ABX3) is rotated according to Glazer's notation.
